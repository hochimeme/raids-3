Raids 3:

Name: Pyramid Plunder 2
Setting: Menaphos Pyramid
  * Known as the "Golden Palace" in RS3, or Jalkabir on the Pharaoh's sceptre
  * Beneath the Golden Palace is the Grand Library, a massive library with books detailing the history of Menaphos and their pantheon
  * Even deeper lies the imperial tombs, where ancient pharaohs and their most prized possessions lay
  * The player will need to fight through avatars of each member of the Menaphite Pantheon while avoiding deadly traps
    * Reminiscent of the fights in Icthlarin's little helper, where they fight manifestions of the Pantheon
    * Intended for 3-5 players
    * Sepulchre style traps must be avoided during each boss fight
    * Perhaps a section of traps must be traversed between fights
    * Scabaras (Fight 1):
      * Beetle-headed god of wisdom and isolation
      * Fight takes place in a dark room (light source required)
      * Each fighter is placed in their own small chamber where they must defeat Scabarites on their own
      * The room has various obstacles that can be used to trap Scabarites -- Each room is slightly different
      * Think of this fight as a combination of the Inferno and Nylos
        * Players must trap monsters to avoid taking a ton of damage
        * A few monsters spawn in at the start, and new ones will continue to spawn over the next few minutes
      * The monsters:
        * Scabaras lancers - meleers
        * Scabaras mages
        * Scabaras rangers
        * Scarab swarms
          * Can be summoned by mages at any time
          * Can be summoned by meleers and rangers when if they can't see the player
          * Hit every tick
        * Scabaras priest
          * Drains prayer with every attack
          * Cast shadow spells that can drain combat stats
          * Attack with ranged or magic depending on your prayer
      * These monsters are all susceptible to Keris and its variants
      * If a player dies in this room, they will not be able to continue with the raid
      * After defeating the minions of Scabaras, the player must traverse a set of sepulchre-style traps to meet back up in Het's boss room
        * Each path should be roughly as difficult as the final sepulchre obstacle
    * Het:
      * Human god of physical and mental health
      * Themes of strength and fortitude
      * Attacks with melee and ranged, which both max over 120
      * Room is rigged with teleportation pads and arrow traps like in the sepulchre
    * Crondis:
      * Crocodile-headed goddess of modesty and resourcefulness
      * Based on the crocodile warrior and follower of Crondis, *Ukunduka*
      * The boss has insatiable hunger, and will heal 20 hp every time it is attacked
        * If a player has food or brews in their inventory, the crocodile will also eat it and heal by that amount *in addition* to the 20 hp per attack
      * Uses all 3 combat styles
        * Hit all players in the room
        * These can be prayer flicked
      * The boss can also do an earthquake attack that causes stones to fall to the ground
        * These are avoidable, but deal hefty typeless damage and heal the boss
      * Since all damage is avoidable and a high max hit is required, the player is pushed towards using Dharok's during this fight
    * Apmeken:
      * Monkey-headed goddess of friendship and social pleasures
      * Like Het's room, this room has arrow traps and teleportation pads, as well as sword traps
      * Boss fight based on Do No Evil, except all 3 must be fought at once
      * 3 monkeys: a gorilla, a baboon, and a monkey
        * These monsters are not affected by the traps in the room
      * The gorilla:
        * Drains prayer with every ranged attack
        * Can charge a player and stun them (avoidable)
        * Melee attack pushes the player backwards
        * Cannot be frozen
      * The baboon:
        * The room is filled with smoke and requires a facemask, but the baboon can remove it randomly
          * If the player's inventory is full, this attack does a max of 80 damage and increases the boss's max hit for the rest of the fight
        * Primarily uses magic, casting shadow and smoke spells that poison the player and drains their stats
      * The monkey:
        * Uses ranged and magic which can be flicked
        * Attacks very fast, every 3 ticks
        * Can summon demons
          * These demons heal the monkey when killed
          * Each demon only uses 1 attack style, but multiple demons of different attack styles can be spawned at once
          * They don't hit that hard
    * After defeating the minor bosses, the players must navigate through a floor of sepulchre style traps to reach Tumeken's room
    * Tumeken:
      * God of the sun
      * His avatar is the final boss
      * Boss room is very warm and experiences a stronger form of desert heat
      * Has very high defense in every stat and is not affected by the dragon warhammer
        * Low magic level, so players will use magic against him
      * Loosely based on the fight at the end of Phite Club
      * Phase 1:
        * Tumeken's avatar has a very strong magic attack that cannot be flicked
        * It also has a weaker ranged and melee attack that can be flicked with a 1 tick window
        * Periodically summons body guards that attack with melee, magic, or ranged
          * Based on imperial warror/mage/ranger akh in the Sophanem slayer dungeon
          * The mages and rangers have a short attack range
          * Their attacks do bleed damage and can bounce from one player to another
          * These can be trapped behind each other or frozen
          * Every time a body guard is killed, every player takes 3% more damage but their max hit is increased by 3%
        * He also causes fire to appear on the ground which must be avoided
          * These eventually disappear, but they stick around for a while and most of the floor will eventually be covered
      * Phase 2:
        * The floor collapses and players find themselves in a much smaller room
        * Tumeken no longer uses ranged or magic autoattacks, and instead only melees the player (which hits through prayer)
        * He cannot be frozen
          * Can be stunned
        * Any players in melee range will be burnt by Tumeken's aura and take massive damage
          * Can be mitigated with dragonfire protection, but it still does a lot of damage
        * Due to the extreme heat in the room, players will need to drink from a fountain in the center of the room periodically
          * Max hit of 200
          * Hits every 10 seconds, but drinking from the fountain provides 20 seconds of immunity
          * Water held in containers will evaporate, including waterskins
          * Tumeken will occasionally walk towards the fountain and destroy it
            * He doesn't 1 hit it, but think of it like jad vs the zuk shield. You can get away with a couple hits, by you really gotta move quick
            * He will stop attacking the fountain if stunned (by a blackjack or jade bolts)
            * Remember that players will still get hit by heat damage if they are in melee range
            * The boss will then target the player who stunned him once the stun wears off
        * Periodically does an attack that sends out 3 magic or ranged attacks in quick succession
          * this will be randomized, e.g. it might send out 1 magic attack, then a ranged attack, then another magic attack
        * The idea is that players will mage the boss in tank armor to avoid heat damage. Periodically, someone will need to step in and hit it with a blackjack to prevent it from destroying the fountain


Rewards:
  * Keris spear
    * Normal stats comparable to a zamorakian spear, but has the Keris effect
    * Special attack has a longer stun against scarabs and kalphites (and can stun large NPCs)
      * Would be useful on Tumeken phase 2
  * Keris dart/arrow tips
    * Can be fletched into ammo usable by the blowpipe and twisted bow
  * Sceptre of the Sun
    * Staff that can be used to cast Tumeken's sun, a spell on the standard spellbook that does high DPS
    * Similar to Storm of Armadyl, but without the minimum hit
    * Uses sun runes, which are the Raids 3 equivalent of vials of blood
    * Really low mage bonus
  * Menaphite blackjack
    * Has a much higher max hit and therefore higher chance to stun
  * Imperial Menaphite armor
    * Inquisators armor but for slash
    * Would be BIS at ToB



Deep beneath the Golden Palace and the Grand Library lie the tombs of ancient pharaohs; their riches guarded by avatars of the Menaphite Pantheon
